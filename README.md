# Using EEG Signals to Condition Variants of GANs

MSc Computer Science thesis. The aim is to create a model capable of generating an approximation of the images seen by people. I attempt to replicate previous work (PeRCeiVe Lab) to condition variants of GANs with EEG brain signals.

Figure 1. A visual representation of this project. The participant views a series of images and the EEG signals are encoded. These encodings are then used by the generator to attempt to predict the image seen.

This project aims to look at how deep learning can be applied to mind reading. It also gives insight on:
1. How the EEG brain signal embeddings compare to one-hot encoding, when used to condition a GAN.
2. What architectures of GANs are best suited for this problem.
